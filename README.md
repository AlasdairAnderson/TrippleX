# TrippleX
Using basic C++ principles I have made a number genertaor guessing game.
The user is asked to guess the 3 numbers to complete the level and is give the sum and the product of those 3 numbers.
Each correct answear increments the level and increases the difficulty.
Once user completes 5 levels the games ends.
For the future I will implement a lives system so that if a player guess is wrong they will be deducted a life.
If player lives hit 0 then the program will stop.
